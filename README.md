# Astra 🚀
The Open-Source No-Code Agent Builder
Astra is a desktop application that empowers anyone—from children to enterprise developers—to build intelligent AI agents through a visual, node-based interface. Create agents locally, run them on your machine, and export them as production-ready containers.

## ✨ Vision

For Beginners & Kids: Drag-and-drop blocks to create AI companions, homework helpers, or creative storytellers
For Developers: Script custom behaviors, connect to APIs, and build enterprise-grade automation
For Everyone: Export agents as Docker containers or use our open agent standard (.xagent.json)

## 🎯 Current Status: Phase 1 (MVP)
### What's Working:

Cross-platform desktop app (Tauri + React)
Visual node editor with React Flow
Basic Python agent runtime
Frontend ↔ Backend communication
Simple agent execution

### Coming Next:

Memory & embeddings support
Tool nodes (APIs, file I/O, web search)
Scripting capabilities
Agent export to open standard
Docker deployment
